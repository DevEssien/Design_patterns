DESIGN PATTERNS

Introduction
Design patterns provides a structured approach for solving challenges and promote best practices in software architecture

Types of Design patterns
- Singleton pattern
- Factory pattern
- Adapter pattern

Singleton Pattern:
Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. The Singleton pattern is useful for 
situations where only one instance of a class should exist.

Factory pattern:
This pattern offers you a way to create objects where the exact class the object is not specified that is to be created.
The Factory pattern is useful when there is complex object creation logic that should not be coupled to client code.

Adapter pattern:
The Adapter Pattern is a design pattern that allows you to bridge the gap between incompatible interfaces or classes, enabling 
them to work together seamlessly. 
in other words, Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
 This pattern is particularly useful in JavaScript development, as it promotes code reusability 
and simplifies the integration of third-party libraries or APIs.
