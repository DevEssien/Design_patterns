PROGRAMMING PARADIGM

Introduction:
Programming paradigm is a way and style in which computer programs are written and organised to solve a problem.

Types of programming paradigm
- imperative programming
- procedural programming
- functional programming
- declarative programming
- object oriented programming

Imperative programming:
This paradigm involves given the computer a specific step to solving a problem

Procedural programming:
This paradigm is a derivative of the imperative. But here, the use of functions to hold each instruction  in the code is used

Functional programming:
this paradigm involves  the use of functions. functions is used here and can be stored in variables , returned from other
functions and so on. Here, functions are used to seperate responsibilities. However, the imperative is still found here, but 
then the function contains code that does not modify any thing in the global scope of the code.

Declarative programming:
this paradigm involves abstracting away, i.e hiding away the steps to a problem (complexity of the instruction and steps) from 
the developer. and bringing the code to human thinking and language. Like in js, the use of reduce, map, filter, find.

Object Oriented Programming: 
this paradigm involves seperating responsibilities and concerns into entities (which are called object classes).
